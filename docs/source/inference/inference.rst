Document Encodings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trained topic models have a number of potential uses.  One key piece of functionality is to take
a text document and provide an encoding of the document that corresonds to the distribution
of latent topics present in the text.  In practical terms, the topic model encoder provides
an algorithm for `doc2vec` where the vector representation can be interpreted as the latent
topic distribution.

To use a trained model in this fashion within a larger application
the ``tmnt.models.bow.runtime`` module provides a simple API to encode documents.
Below is an example::

  python 
  >>> from tmnt.inference import BowVAEInferencer
  >>> infer = BowVAEInferencer.from_saved(model_dir = '_model_dir')
  >>> encodings = infer.encode_batch(['Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the
        Black Sea, to the Mediterranean, so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care.',
        'I have two pairs of headphones I\'d like to sell.  These are excellent, and both in great condition'])

The resulting ``encodings`` is an ``NDArray`` with shape ``(N,K)`` where ``N`` is the number of texts/documents encoded and ``K`` is the number of topics.

You can use the method ``mx.nd.argsort`` to get the order of components (i.e. topics) in ascending probability, e.g.::

  >>> import mxnet as mx
  >>> mx.nd.argsort(encodings[0])

Note also the ``NDArray`` objects can be converted to numpy objects via::

  >>> enc_0_np = encodings[0].asnumpy()

If the model trained was a (categorical) co-variate model, each batch of texts to encoder should have corresponding
co-variate values.  This is done by adding an array of strings of the same length as the text array passed to ``encode_batch``
where the strings are the co-variate values that are provided in the ``.vec`` input files.  For example, if the co-variate
involved sentiment and had possible values ``positive``, ``neutral`` and ``negative``, the invocation above might look like::

  >>> encodings = text_encoder.encode_batch(['Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the
      Black Sea, to the Mediterranean, so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care.',
      'I have two pairs of headphones I\'d like to sell.  These are excellent, and both in great condition'],
      covars=['neutral', 'positive'])
