  # We just set up a conda environment with the right Python version. This
  # should not need changing.

  # - conda create --yes -n docs python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION
  # - source activate docs

  # Below, include the dependencies you want to install with conda, optionally
  # specifying versions used in the matrix above. If you split this into
  # multiple conda install commands, you should always include numpy=$NUMPY as
  # the first package to install (for every conda install command) otherwise
  # numpy may be automatically upgraded.
